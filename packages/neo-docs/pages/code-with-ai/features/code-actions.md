# Code Actions

Code Actions are a powerful feature of VS Code that provide quick fixes, refactorings, and other code-related suggestions directly within the editor. Neo Code integrates with this system to offer AI-powered assistance for common coding tasks.

## Available Code Actions

The extension provides code actions via the editor context menu and lightbulb:

- **Add to Context:** Adds selected code (with file path and line numbers) to the active chat session. Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+K Cmd+A` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K Ctrl+A` (Windows/Linux).
- **Explain Code:** Asks Neo to explain the selected code.
- **Fix Code:** Asks Neo to fix problems in the selected code.
- **Improve Code:** Asks Neo to suggest improvements to the selected code.

### Agent Manager Integration

If the **Agent Manager** is active, code actions route to the current Agent Manager session rather than the sidebar chat. This allows code actions to work seamlessly within multi-session workflows.

### Terminal Context Menu

The extension also adds code actions to the **terminal context menu**:

- **Add Terminal Content:** Adds selected terminal output to the chat context.
- **Fix Command:** Asks Neo to fix a failed terminal command.
- **Explain Command:** Asks Neo to explain a terminal command or its output.

By using Neo Code's Code Actions, you can quickly get AI-powered assistance directly within your coding workflow. This can save you time and help you write better code.
