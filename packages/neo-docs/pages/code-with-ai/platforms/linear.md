# Neo for Linear

**Neo for Linear** connects Neo Code to your Linear workspace, so you can trigger implementations, debug issues, and investigate bugs directly from your project management tool. Mention `@neo` on any issue and the bot gets to work.

---

## What You Can Do

### Fix issues from Linear

Tag the bot on any Linear issue and tell it to implement the fix:

```
@neo please fix
```

The bot will:

- Read the issue title, description, and comments
- Spin up a Cloud Agent to implement the solution
- Show a thinking/processing animation in Linear while it works
- Link the resulting pull request back to the issue

### Apply changes across multiple repositories

If a fix or upgrade needs to land in several repos at once:

```
@neo please fix this in the cloud, landing, and handbook repos
```

The bot handles each repository independently, creating separate branches and pull requests for each.

### Get help understanding an issue

Before jumping into a fix, ask the bot to analyze the problem:

```
@neo what could be the cause of this issue?
```

The bot examines the issue context and searches the connected codebase to surface likely causes.

## How It Works

1. **Mention `@neo`** in a comment on a Linear issue
2. **Neo reads the issue context** — title, description, labels, and comment thread
3. **A Cloud Agent spins up** to process the request (you'll see a thinking animation in Linear while this happens)
4. **Neo responds** with an answer or opens a pull request with the implementation

When Neo creates a pull request, it links back to the Linear issue so everything stays connected.

## Prerequisites

- A Neo Code account with available credits
- Your GitHub or GitLab integration configured via the Integrations tab at [app.neo.khulnasoft.com](https://app.neo.khulnasoft.com)
- Access to a Linear workspace where you can install integrations

---

## Setup

1. Go to [app.neo.khulnasoft.com](https://app.neo.khulnasoft.com) and navigate to the **Integrations** tab
2. Set up the **Linear** integration
3. Authorize Neo to access your Linear workspace

Once connected, `@neo` is available as a mention in any issue across your Linear workspace.

## Use Cases

### Sprint Cleanup

Have a backlog of well-described bugs? Tag the bot on each one and let it work through them while you focus on higher-priority work.

### Cross-Repo Upgrades

Need to upgrade a framework version or apply a config change across several services? Create a single Linear issue describing the change, then tell the bot which repos to update.

### Issue Investigation

When a bug report is unclear or the root cause isn't obvious, ask the bot to analyze the issue before committing to a fix. It can search the codebase and surface likely problem areas.

---

## Cost

Neo Code credits are consumed the same way as any other Neo interface. Credit usage depends on the model selected and the complexity of the task.

---

## Tips for Best Results

- **Write clear issue descriptions.** The bot works best when the issue title and description give enough context to understand the problem and the expected outcome.
- **Mention specific repositories** if the change needs to land in more than one.
- **Start with diagnosis for ambiguous issues.** Ask the bot to analyze the issue before asking it to fix.

---

## Troubleshooting

**The bot isn't responding to mentions.**
Confirm that the Linear integration is set up in the Integrations tab at [app.neo.khulnasoft.com](https://app.neo.khulnasoft.com) and that the bot has access to your workspace.

**The bot can't access the repository.**
Make sure your GitHub or GitLab integration is configured and that the relevant repositories are authorized.

**The pull request doesn't match what I expected.**
Provide more detail in the issue description, or comment with additional context before asking the bot to fix.
