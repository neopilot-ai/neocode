# Neo Code Integrations

Neo Integrations lets you connect GitHub or GitLab for repository workflows and DoltHub for Dolt-versioned data. Once connected, Neo can access authorized resources securely, enabling features like **Code Reviews**, **Cloud Agents**, **Neo Deploy**, and data workflows through **Neo Connect**.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Integration Type | Details |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | GitHub App | [GitHub Setup](#connecting-github) |
| GitLab | OAuth or PAT | [GitLab Setup](#connecting-gitlab) |
| DoltHub | OAuth | [DoltHub Setup](#connecting-dolthub) |

## What You Can Do With Integrations

- **Connect GitHub, GitLab, or DoltHub to Neo Code** in a few clicks
- **Enable advanced features** like Cloud Agents, Code Reviews, and Neo Deploy
- **Authorize GitHub or GitLab repository access** so Neo can analyze and work with your code
- **Query Dolt-versioned data** and authorize DoltHub access for Gas Town Wasteland

## Prerequisites

Before connecting:

- You must have a **GitHub** or **GitLab** account.
- For GitHub: You need permission to install GitHub Apps for the repositories you want Neo to access.
- For GitLab: You need **Maintainer** role (or higher) on the projects you want to connect.
- For DoltHub: You need a DoltHub account to authorize the OAuth connection.
- (Optional) If you're connecting an organization, you must be an admin or have app installation permissions.

## Connecting GitHub

### 1. Open the Integrations Page

Go to your **Personal** or **Organization Dashboard**, and navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.neo.khulnasoft.com/integrations) tab.

### 2. Start the Connection Flow

1. Click **Configure** on the GitHub panel.
2. You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the **NeoConnect** App.
3. Select the GitHub account or organization you want to connect.

### 3. Choose Repository Access

GitHub will ask which repositories you want Neo to access:

- **All repositories** (recommended if you plan to use Cloud Agents or Deploy across multiple projects)
- **Only selected repositories** (choose specific repos)

Click **Install & Authorize** to continue.

### 4. Complete Authorization

Once approved:

- You'll return to the Neo Integrations page.
- GitHub will show a **Connected** status.
- Your Neo workspace can now access GitHub repositories securely.

## Connecting GitLab

You can connect GitLab using **OAuth** or a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. Both **GitLab.com** and **self-hosted GitLab instances** are supported.

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="OAuth (GitLab.com)" %}

1. Go to the **Integrations** page:
   - **Personal**: [app.neo.khulnasoft.com/integrations/gitlab](https://app.neo.khulnasoft.com/integrations/gitlab)
   - **Organization**: Your organization → Integrations → GitLab
2. Click **Connect GitLab**
3. Authorize the application on GitLab
4. You'll be redirected back to Neo with the connection active

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="OAuth (Self-Hosted)" %}

For self-hosted GitLab instances using OAuth, you need to register an OAuth application first:

1. In your GitLab instance, go to **Admin Area → Applications** (or **User Settings → Applications**)
2. Create a new application:
   - **Name**: `Neo Code`
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://app.neo.khulnasoft.com/api/integrations/gitlab/callback`
   - **Scopes**: `api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`, `write_repository`
   - **Confidential**: Yes
3. Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret**
4. In Neo, go to the GitLab integration page
5. Enter your **Instance URL**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**
6. Click **Connect** and authorize

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Personal Access Token" %}

1. In GitLab, go to **User Settings → Access Tokens**
2. Create a token with the `api` scope
3. Copy the token
4. In Neo, go to the GitLab integration page
5. Paste the token (and enter your Instance URL for self-hosted)
6. Click **Connect**

> PAT tokens cannot be refreshed automatically. When your token expires, create a new one in GitLab and reconnect in Neo.

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Connecting DoltHub

Use the DoltHub integration page to connect your DoltHub account. Neo uses this OAuth connection for [Neo Connect](/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/neo-connect) and as the default auth method for [Gas Town Wasteland](/docs/code-with-ai/gastown/wasteland).

1. Go to the **Integrations** page:
   - **Personal**: [app.neo.khulnasoft.com/integrations/dolthub](https://app.neo.khulnasoft.com/integrations/dolthub)
   - **Organization**: Your organization → Integrations → DoltHub
2. Click **Connect DoltHub**.
3. Approve Neo on DoltHub.
4. Return to Neo and confirm DoltHub shows a **Connected** status.

To remove the connection, click **Disconnect** from the DoltHub integration page.

## What Happens After Connecting

Once your integrations are connected, the following features are enabled in Neo:

### Cloud Agents

- Run Neo Code in the cloud from any device
- Auto-create branches and push work continuously
- Work from anywhere while keeping your repo in sync

### Code Reviews

- Automated AI review on every pull request or merge request
- Consistent feedback based on your team's standards
- See the [Code Reviews guide](/docs/automate/code-reviews/overview) for setup

### Neo Deploy

- Deploy Next.js 14 & 15 apps directly from Neo
- Trigger rebuilds automatically on push
- Manage deployment logs and history

### DoltHub data access

- Query Dolt-versioned databases from your workspace
- Use DoltHub alongside GitHub or GitLab when a workflow also needs repository access
- Authorize Gas Town Wasteland to fork commons databases, push claims and evidence, and manage DoltHub PRs. Wasteland also supports an advanced API token option when OAuth is not available.

### Upcoming:

- **Bitbucket Integration**

## Managing or Removing the Integration

### GitHub

From the **Integrations** page, click "Manage on GitHub" to:

- View the GitHub account you connected
- Update which repositories Neo has access to
- Disconnect GitHub entirely
- Reauthorize the app if permissions change

### GitLab

From the **Integrations** page:

- Click **Disconnect** to remove the GitLab connection
- Your tokens are cleared, but webhook configuration is preserved so reconnecting restores your setup

> Disconnecting from Neo does not revoke OAuth tokens on GitLab's side. You can manually revoke them from **GitLab → User Settings → Applications → Authorized Applications**.

### DoltHub

From the **Integrations** page, open DoltHub to:

- View the connected status
- View granted permissions
- Disconnect DoltHub from Neo

---

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub

**"I don't see my repositories."**
Ensure the NeoConnect App is installed for the correct GitHub org and that repo access includes the repositories you need.

**"My organization blocks third-party apps."**
You may need an admin to approve installing GitHub Apps.

**"Cloud Agents or Deploy can't access my repo."**
Revisit the GitHub app settings and confirm the app has the correct repo scope.

### GitLab

**"No projects listed after connecting."**
Click the refresh button to sync projects from GitLab. Ensure your GitLab account has access to the projects you expect.

**"Permission denied" errors.**
You need **Maintainer role** on the GitLab project for webhook and bot token creation.

**"Token expired."**

- **OAuth**: Tokens refresh automatically. If refresh fails, reconnect from the integration page.
- **PAT**: Create a new token in GitLab and reconnect in Neo.

**"Self-hosted connection issues."**

- Verify your instance URL is accessible from the internet
- Ensure HTTPS is configured
- Check that OAuth application scopes include all required scopes
- Verify the redirect URI matches: `https://app.neo.khulnasoft.com/api/integrations/gitlab/callback`
