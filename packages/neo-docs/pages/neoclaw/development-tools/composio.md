# Composio Integration

Connect Composio to your NeoClaw agent to instantly unlock access to 250+ tool integrations — from Salesforce and HubSpot to Notion, Jira, and beyond. Composio is a platform that handles the authentication and connection details for each service, so your agent can use them without you having to set up each one individually.

Browse the full list of toolkits Composio supports at [composio.dev/toolkits](https://composio.dev/toolkits). If a toolkit you need is listed there, you can connect it to NeoClaw through Composio in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A **Composio account** — sign up for free at [composio.dev](https://composio.dev)
- A **NeoClaw agent** already set up — see the [Dashboard Reference](/docs/neoclaw/dashboard) if you haven't done this yet

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Composio account and get your API key

1. Go to [composio.dev](https://composio.dev) and sign up for a free account
2. Once logged in, open the **Settings** or **API Keys** section of your Composio dashboard
3. Click **Create API Key**, give it a name (for example, `neoclaw`), and copy the key

### Step 2: Add the API key to NeoClaw

1. Go to the **Settings** tab on your [NeoClaw dashboard](/docs/neoclaw/dashboard)
2. Scroll to the **Integrations** section and find **Composio**
3. Paste the API key into the **Composio API Key** field
4. Click **Save**
5. **Redeploy** your instance to apply the changes

### Step 3: Authenticate tools in Composio

Composio acts as a bridge between NeoClaw and each third-party service. To allow your agent to use a specific tool, you need to authorise it once inside Composio:

1. In your Composio dashboard, go to **Integrations** or **Connected Accounts**
2. Find the tool you want (for example, Slack, Notion, or Jira)
3. Click **Connect** and follow the authentication steps for that service
4. Once connected, the tool is immediately available to your NeoClaw agent

Repeat this for each service your agent needs to access.

## What Your Agent Can Do

Once connected, your NeoClaw agent can use any tool you have authenticated in Composio. With 250+ integrations available, this includes:

| Category | Example tools |
|---|---|
| **Project management** | Jira, Notion, Asana, Trello, ClickUp |
| **Communication** | Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams |
| **Development** | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket |
| **CRM & sales** | Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive |
| **Documents & storage** | Google Drive, Dropbox, Confluence |
| **Databases** | Airtable, Supabase, PostgreSQL |

Your agent can perform actions like reading data, creating records, sending messages, and triggering workflows — all through natural language prompts.
