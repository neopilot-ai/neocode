# Using DeepSeek With Neo Code

Neo Code supports accessing models through the DeepSeek API, including `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner`.

**Website:** [https://platform.deepseek.com/](https://platform.deepseek.com/)

## Getting an API Key

1.  **Sign Up/Sign In:** Go to the [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/). Create an account or sign in.
2.  **Navigate to API Keys:** Find your API keys in the [API keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) section of the platform.
3.  **Create a Key:** Click "Create new API key". Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Neo Code").
4.  **Copy the Key:** **Important:** Copy the API key _immediately_. You will not be able to see it again. Store it securely.

## Configuration in Neo Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

Open **Settings** (gear icon) and go to the **Providers** tab to add DeepSeek and enter your API key.

The extension stores this in your `neo.json` config file. You can also edit the config file directly — see the **CLI** tab for the file format.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="CLI" %}

Set the API key as an environment variable or configure it in your `neo.json` config file:

**Environment variable:**

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

**Config file** (`~/.config/neo/neo.json` or `./neo.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "provider": {
    "deepseek": {
      "env": ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"],
    },
  },
}
```

Then set your default model:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
}
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Tips and Notes

- **Pricing:** Refer to the [DeepSeek Pricing](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing/) page for details on model costs.
